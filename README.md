# `PetCoin`

Welcome to your new `PetCoin` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

`PetCoin` is a platform designed to facilitate donations in a secure, transparent, and engaging way. Users can donate to people in need using Plug Wallet, sending ICP tokens directly to the recipient's address. The platform is fully integrated with Internet Identity (ICP login), ensuring that all transactions are traceable and transparent.

To make the donation experience more interactive, `PetCoin` provides collectible pet cards and accessories as rewards for donors. Each donation earns the donor a card or accessory, which can be collected, displayed, and even traded within the platform. Additionally, a gacha system is implemented to make collecting pets more fun: donors can spend PetCoins to perform a “gacha pull” and receive random pets or accessories. This gamification encourages users to engage more with the platform while supporting real causes.

```

## Running the project locally
To run this project, you must use Linux or WSL2 on Windows. The DFINITY SDK and Motoko canisters are optimized for Linux environments. Running on pure Windows or macOS may cause errors. If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

1. Installation and Setup
First, make sure you have the DFINITY SDK and Node.js installed.
If you don't have it, install the DFINITY SDK with this command:

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -sS https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

2. Cloning the Repository
Copy the project code to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucy850/PETCOIN_WCHL_PROJECT1
```

3. Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm install @dfinity/agent@0.15.7 @dfinity/auth-client@0.15.7 @dfinity/candid@0.15.7 @dfinity/identity@0.15.7 --legacy-peer-deps
```

4. Running and Deploying

```bash
dfx start --background
```

After the replica starts in the new terminal, return to your original terminal to deploy your canisters:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

5. Generate Backend Declarations
Run only once to generate backend declarations

```bash
dfx generate PetCoin_backend
```

6. Running the Frontend

```bash
cd src/PetCoin_frontend/public/my-icp-login
npm run dev
```

7. Build frontend for production (output in dist/, use for hosting/deployment)

```bash
npm run build
```

8. Stopping the Replica

```bash
dfx stop
```

## Deployment to Mainnet
1. Create a Secure Identity
```bash
dfx identity new (your-secure-identity)
dfx identity use (your-secure-identity)
```
2. Check Cycles
Verify your identity has enough cycles to deploy canisters:
```bash
dfx ledger account-id
```
3. Deploy Canisters to Mainnet
```bash
dfx deploy --network ic

```


## Canister IDs

### Local Deployment
- PetCoin_frontend: `u6s2n-gx777-77774-qaaba-cai`
- PetCoin_backend: `uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai`
- Internet Identity: `uxrrr-q7777-77774-qaaaq-cai`
  

## ICP Features Used
- Internet Identity (II) for secure, passwordless login
- Plug Wallet Integration for sending and receiving ICP tokens
- Custom Token (PetCoin) canister for rewarding users with donation credits
- On-chain Transparency: all donations and rewards are recorded on the Internet Computer
- Scalable Canisters: backend canister built in Motoko to manage donations, balances, and collectibles

## Challenges Faced
- Wallet Integration: Handling Plug Wallet connection and ICP balance validation before transactions
- Donation Tracking: Ensuring transparency while keeping data secure and private
- Frontend Responsiveness: Optimizing the UI for mobile devices while integrating multiple ICP features
- Canister Management: Keeping backend, frontend, and token canisters in sync during deployment
- Error Handling: Managing failed transactions, network issues, or wallet disconnections gracefully
- Gamification Design: Making the gacha system engaging while keeping it fair and balanced
- Scalability: Ensuring the backend canister can handle many users and donations simultaneously
- User Experience: Providing intuitive UI/UX for both new donors and returning users
- Testing & Debugging: Difficulty in testing canisters locally and ensuring accurate state across frontend and backend

## Target Solution
Many people want to donate to those in need, but traditional donation platforms often lack engagement or rewards, making the process less appealing.
PetCoin solves this by:
- Offering a secure and transparent donation system on the Internet Computer using ICP and Plug Wallet.
- Adding gamification: donors can collect unique virtual pets through a gacha system.
- Making donations fun, interactive, and rewarding, encouraging more frequent participation.

## How It Works
1. Default Flow
   If no custom wallet is set, the canister principal automatically receives all top-ups and donations.
2. Custom Flow
   You can set a platform wallet (any principal) to receive the main payments.
3. Revenue Flow
   - User Top-Up / Donation → goes to the Platform Wallet
   - Platform Wallet distributes the funds:
     - 95% → Donation to Pet / Creator
     - 5% → Kept as Platform Fee
    
 
## System Architecture Description
